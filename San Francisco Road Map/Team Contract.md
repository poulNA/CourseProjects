# Communication
## Team Meetings: 
Our team will meet once a week every Tuesday and Fridays meet 1 hour in-person. Meet with our TA once a week for 30min. Paulj3 will be the designated note-taker. Notes will be stored on a Google document, time-stamped for each meeting. Everybody will take turns drafting the weekly DEVELOPMENT LOG entry, starting with paulj3, which is approved by the team at the start of the following week’s meeting.
## Assistance:
 Each team member can be contacted through email, Discord, or text message. Outside of emergencies or other commitments, we commit to responding to emails within 24 hours.
## Respect:
 Each member will rotate as a "project manager" each week. Their role is to ensure that each member of the group has had the opportunity to express themselves on a design decision or on any other subject related to the final project. Majority agreement is required. By signing this document, each member of the team agrees to adhere to the decisions taken, even if they personally disagree with them.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
# Collaboration
## Work Distribution: 
We will decide the work flow for the 6 weeks before we start the project. The leader for the week will have the responsibility to make sure everyone turns in their work by the end of the week. Each week, everyone needs to agree on a time to meet with the TA so that we stay on the right track. If we are lagging behind, we will immediately address the concern and make extra efforts to meet the deadline. We will try to finish the project beforehand so that we have enough time for debugging and preparing the deliverables before the date of submission. Workload will be more for the starting weeks so that we don't have much to worry about as we approach finals week.
## Time Commitment: 
To ensure an equal distribution of work, each member is expected to independently work no less than two and no more than six hours per week on the project. If some work takes up more time than expected, then each member should acknowledge the situation and make time to complete the work by the deadline. Working as a team and taking out appropriate time for the work is important so that the work is distributed evenly and no one feels overburdened.
However if a team member is habitually not being involved , they may be asked – politely – to explain their circumstances. Based on their explanation further actions, such as alerting a staff member, may be taken on a case by case basis decided by the other team members.
## Conflict Resolution: 
All conflicts within the team will be decided by a red hands competition. The winner will decide who was right and who was wrong (Might makes right).
