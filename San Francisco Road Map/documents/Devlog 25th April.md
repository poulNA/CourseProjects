# Meeting Agendas

The main agenda for this week was to make test cases and test whether the code covers all the test cases. In addition to that, we also needed to fix the make file. With the input from our TA, we were able to make considerable progress.

# Team Members Contribution

Shubh and Pranshu worked on fixing the Make file. Whereas, Paul and Dev were making the test cases to test the Djikstras algorithm and the data parsing code.
  
# Next Week's Agenda

Next week, we need to implement our third and final algorithm and then make all of the algorithms work together.
