# Development Log - Week 3

# Meeting Times

4/11 - 7pm to 10pm

4/15 - 6pm to 9pm

# Meeting Agendas

The agenda for this week was to load the data in the required datasets- maps and vectors. In addition to this, we had to implement the Djikstra's algorthm so that the shortest path could be found. Also. we needed to test whether the Djisktra's worked on the datsaset we had created.

# Team Members Contribution

Shubh and Paul worked on parsing the nodes and the edges and putting them in the datasets- maps and vectors. Pranshu and Dev worked on implementing the Djikstra's algorithm. The Djikstra's algorithm was tested with the data that had been parsed.

# Next Week's Agenda

Want to create the test cases in order to check the complete functionality of the code we have written. We need to weed out the edge cases and test the code thoroughly. Also we need to find path between two nodes going through one specific node. This will be a challenging week where we need to bring the project to life.
