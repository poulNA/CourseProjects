# Development Log - Week 2 

# Meeting Times

4/5 - 9pm - 11pm

4/10 - 7pm to 10pm

# Meeting Agendas

On 4/5, we revised the proposal based on the feedback provided by our TA. We re-evaluated certain things.
In addition to this, we discussed our approach towards each of our individual tasks.

On 4/10, we started implementing the Djikstra's algorithm. In addition to that, we have also started loading the dataset into the class.

We are currently on track and are in line with the agenda that we had set for the two weeks.

# Team members contribution

Pranshu and Dev worked on the Djikstra's algorithm whereas Shubh and Pworked on the dataset. They started loading the dataset into the class.

# Next week's agenda

We have planned to finish these two points by the end of next week, in time for the mid-project checkin.
