# Meeting Agendas

This week, our team worked more to get things moving. The main agenda was to get the third and final algorithm working. Also, some work on test cases had to be done.


# Team Members Contribution

We'd say everyone worked together to get the final algorithm working. Other than that, Paul and Pranshu worked on some test cases while Shubh and Dev were working on drawing nodes.



# Next Week's Agenda

The next week is the final week and the goal is to get all the code working and complete the documentation for our project.
