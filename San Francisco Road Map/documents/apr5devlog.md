Goal: Organize the dataset and load it so that it is ready for use. 
We have set up the general layout of Graph class and copied the dataset files.
We just started to parse through the dataset with fstream.

# 2
Collectively, we worked on improving our proposal. 
Collectively, we researched how to best use fstream to read the data. 
Collectively, we decided what functions and properties our class needs.

# 3
We are still working out how to best use fstream to read data and set up the data as vectors.

# 4
We will finish organizing data into functional vectors.
We will start making graphs with the vectors and add any more functions or properties that are necessary.
